    <h2>Description</h2>These breaded and fried pork cutlets make a traditional Japanese dish which is very simple and easy to make. Serve with sticky rice and tonkatsu sauce and enjoy! Also great if substituted with chicken breasts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pork chops between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness (about .75 cm). Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Pour oil into a skillet about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Place the flour, egg, and panko crumbs in separate bowls. Coat each cutlet in flour, then egg, and finally in bread crumbs. Tap off any loose crumbs. </li>
        <li>Fry the cutlets until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
